## Data Description
Chicago Crime Data from https://data.cityofchicago.org/PublicSafety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 provide reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago. These data are available from 2001 through the present. I have used 2018 data for analysis

## What is in the App
The following have been covered in the app.
* Frequency of crime by month and crime type
* Frequency of crime by the location of the crime
* A heatmap using the type of crime and the hour of the day when the crime was committed
* Latitude and longitude of crimes by date on a map allowing user to filter the map using dates. Also, hovering over an observation in the map, it provides relevant information
about the crime
